# Web Portfolio

This web portfolio is the second version of my online portfolio. The portfolio explains a lot about me and what I do in the field of Computer Science. The portfolio has a significant difference from my [first version](https://leonw00.github.io/), which is a static portfolio. There's much more to this portfolio such as the layout responsive, animations, transition, and more.

# Technicalities

This project is built with React and Framer Motion is used for the animation. For this portfolio, I use AWS Amplify to it and bought a custom domain for it. Additional libraries that I use here is Material-UI, where I use the tooltip component to show the text of icons when hovered.
